## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis and visualization of sales trends in the Retail and Food Services sectors across the United States. Leveraging authentic data sourced directly from official U.S. government portals, the dataset has been efficiently structured using SQL into a relational database. The primary objective is to explore sales metrics categorized by NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes and associated categories for better industry insight.

## Dataset
The dataset features historical sales records for Retail and Food Services in the U.S., obtained from trusted government sources to ensure data reliability. It includes comprehensive fields such as:

- NAICS industry codes

- Category classifications

- Sales revenue

- Geographic region

- Temporal data (monthly and yearly)

This rich dataset forms the foundation for meaningful trend analysis and forecasting.



## Database
To streamline data handling and enable powerful querying, a SQL-based relational database has been designed and implemented. The schema is optimized for structured storage, effective retrieval, and compatibility with modern data visualization platforms. PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness and support for complex analytical queries, ensuring smooth data integration and exploration.

## Data Processing
Prior to analysis, the raw data undergoes necessary preprocessing to clean, structure, and standardize it. Using SQL, operations such as filtering, transformation, and formatting are performed to ensure high data integrity. This step is crucial for preparing a reliable dataset that drives accurate insights through the dashboard.
